2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette
3. Type "Stata: Test MCP Server Connection" and press Enter
4. You should see a success message if the server is properly connected

### Cursor Configuration File Paths

The location of Cursor MCP configuration files varies by operating system:

- **macOS**:
  - Primary location: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Alternative location: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/mcp.json`

- **Windows**:
  - Primary location: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`
  - Alternative location: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\mcp.json`

- **Linux**:
  - Primary location: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Alternative location: `~/.config/Cursor/User/mcp.json`

### Manual Cursor Configuration

If you need to manually configure Cursor MCP:

1. Create or edit the MCP configuration file:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`

2. Add the Stata MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "url": "http://localhost:4000/mcp",
         "transport": "sse"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. If the file already contains other MCP servers, just add the `"stata-mcp"` entry to the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

4. Save the file and restart Cursor.

### Troubleshooting Cursor Configuration

If Cursor is not recognizing the Stata MCP server:
1. Verify the MCP server is running
2. Check that the configuration file exists with the correct content
3. Try restarting Cursor
4. Ensure there are no port conflicts with other running applications

## Cline MCP Configuration

This extension automatically configures Cline MCP settings when Cline is installed in VS Code. You can control this behavior with the `stata-vscode.autoConfigureCline` setting.

To verify the connection:
1. Make sure the extension is active (open a .do file)
2. Open Cline in VS Code
3. Check if Stata commands work in your Cline conversation

### Manual Cline Configuration

If you need to manually configure Cline:

1. Open your Cline MCP settings file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

2. Add the Stata MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "url": "http://localhost:4000/mcp",
         "transport": "sse"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. If the file already contains other MCP servers, just add the `"stata-mcp"` entry to the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

4. Save the file and restart VS Code.

You can also configure Cline through VS Code settings:
```json
"cline.mcpSettings": {
  "stata-mcp": {
    "url": "http://localhost:4000/mcp",
    "transport": "sse"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Cline Configuration

If Cline is not recognizing the Stata MCP server:
1. Verify the MCP server is running (Status bar should show "Stata")
2. Check that the configuration file exists with the correct content
3. Try restarting VS Code
4. Check the extension output panel (View > Output > Stata MCP) for any errors

## Claude Desktop MCP Configuration

You can use this extension with Claude Desktop through mcp-proxy:

1. Make sure the Stata MCP extension is installed in VS Code or Cursor and currently running before attempting to configure Claude Desktop
2. Install mcp-proxy:
   ```bash
   # Using pip
   pip install mcp-proxy
   
   # Or using uv (faster)
   uv install mcp-proxy
   ```

3. Find the path to mcp-proxy:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   which mcp-proxy
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   (Get-Command mcp-proxy).Path
   ```

4. Configure Claude Desktop by editing the MCP config file:

   **On Windows** (typically at `%APPDATA%\Claude Desktop\claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "command": "mcp-proxy",
         "args": ["http://127.0.0.1:4000/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **On macOS** (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude Desktop/claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "command": "/path/to/mcp-proxy",
         "args": ["http://127.0.0.1:4000/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/mcp-proxy` with the actual path you found in step 3.

5. Restart Claude Desktop

6. Claude Desktop will automatically discover the available Stata tools, allowing you to run Stata commands and analyze data directly from your conversations.

> **Note:** There is an alternative way to use Stata MCP in Claude Desktop without installing this extension. See [here](https://github.com/SepineTam/stata-mcp).

## Python Environment Management
